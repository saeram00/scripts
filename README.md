# Utility scripts

This is intended to become a collection of utility scripts I'll create for
personal use, but anyone is welcome to clone the repo and use them if they find
anything useful.

In order to use them you would only need to invoke them with their respective
interpreter (`bash`, `sh`, `python`, etc.), or set the executable permission
bit with `chmod`, as most (if not all) will have their respective shebang
(`#!`) at the start.

## Currently available

* [`go-dl`](./go-dl/): A simple Bash script to download and install the latest
version of Golang from their official website.

## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome if you find bugs or a more efficient way of achieving
the same result. Keep in mind that readability and maintainability are
important for me, so please account for that in any ideas you'd like to
implement.
